/**
 * Execution is not this section's. It is the agent-harness carrier's
 * (`agent-harness-computer-system-engineering-services-section/carrier/agency-carrier`: `agencyWorkCarrier`
 * binds a dialect, a character and a data root and returns a provider that runs one allocated duty as
 * one agent-CLI session and answers the typed outcome). This module defines the port the section
 * dispatches through, and an adapter that makes a carrier a port.
 *
 *   port       { dispatch(workOrder, { signal }) -> Promise<FabricationDeliveryCandidate> }
 *   work order FabricationWorkOrder: the plan's steps, the deliverables and the assays, under a work lot
 *
 * No default executor is wired. The carrier is not safely invocable from here: it needs a duty
 * already allocated by the MetroPlat work rail to a character (its `item.allocation`, `item.delegation`,
 * office and method), a host-wide provider lease, a dialect, and it spawns a CLI session that writes to
 * the node's data root. `carrierExecutor` therefore takes the carrier, and the allocator that turns a
 * work order into the rail's duty, from the host that owns them; `unboundExecutor` is the default and
 * refuses, so a section that has not been wired never pretends to produce anything.
 *
 * The orchestration (`produceFabrication`) is the pattern of knowledge production
 * (`computer-systems-fabrication/knowledge/knowledge-production`) with the demand source swapped from
 * harness read events to buyer orders: order -> work order -> dispatch -> assay -> delivery -> market outcome.
