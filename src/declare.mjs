/**
 * MetroPlat operation declarations for the section's operations, so their Hoare program contracts
 * derive (`deriveProgramContract` over a `metroplat.action` declaration, which the x402 market
 * deriver reads from `x-market.metroplat`). The factory takes `operationDeclaration` and `schemaFrom`
 * as arguments so the declarations can be built, and tested, wherever those packages are installed;
 * `metroplat-operations.mjs` binds them to `@red-cup-engineering/relating`.
 *
 * Every operation is a pure function of its input: it reads no resource and writes none, so its
 * precondition is its input schema, its postcondition is its output schema, and its preserved frame
 * is everything else.
